Contributed to a peer-reviewed clinical research study evaluating smartphone-based semen analysis under real-world conditions, comparing remote assessments with laboratory-based CASA measurements.

**Highlights:**
- Analyzed agreement, reproducibility, and diagnostic performance across remote and laboratory-based measurements
- Worked with clinical datasets involving sperm concentration, motility, and related quality metrics
- Findings support smartphone-based systems as scalable tools for population-level research and clinical screening
